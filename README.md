# Post-Graduate-Projects

 *Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:*
   - Utilize sensors or devices capable of measuring spectral data, such as near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, to collect the spectral signatures of different types of plastics.
   - Preprocess the acquired spectral data by removing noise, baseline correction, and normalization to ensure accurate analysis.
*Maximum Peak Analysis in Python:*
   - Implement a Python script using libraries like NumPy and SciPy to perform maximum peak analysis on the preprocessed spectral data.
   - Identify distinctive peak wavelengths associated with each type of plastic, leveraging algorithms like peak detection or spectral pattern matching, allowing for the segregation of different plastics based on their unique spectral characteristics.
